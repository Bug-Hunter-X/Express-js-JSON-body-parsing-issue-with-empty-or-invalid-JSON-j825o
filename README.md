# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.  The problem arises when the request body is empty or contains invalid JSON data.

## Problem Description

When an empty or malformed JSON payload is sent to an Express.js route that uses `express.json()` middleware, the request body (`req.body`) is undefined or does not contain the expected data.  This leads to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully manage cases where the request body is not valid JSON.  This can be achieved by either checking for the existence of `req.body` or using a try-catch block to handle JSON parsing errors.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/user` with an empty body or an invalid JSON body using a tool like Postman or curl.

You'll observe that the server will fail to properly process the request in the case of invalid JSON.
